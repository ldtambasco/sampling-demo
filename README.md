# Sampling Distribution of the Mean — Interactive Demo

This Streamlit app illustrates how the **sampling distribution of the sample mean** behaves as:
1. The **population distribution** changes (from symmetric to skewed), and
2. The **sample size** increases.

The app dynamically simulates samples from a chosen population and displays:
- The **Population Distribution**
- The **Sampling Distribution of the Mean**
- A **Q–Q Plot** showing how the sampling means approximate a normal distribution
- A **Theoretical Normal Curve** with mean = μ and standard error = σ/√n
